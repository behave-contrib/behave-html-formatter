Feature: Make behave generate HTML as output

  As a package maintainer
  I want to execute the HTML formatter and verify its output
  So that I can ensure integration and basic functionality.

  Scenario: Run behave with HTML formatter
    Given a file named "behave.ini" with:
      """
      [behave.formatters]
      html = behave_html_formatter:HTMLFormatter
      """
    When I run "behave --format html"
    Then it should pass
    And the command output should contain:
      """
      <!DOCTYPE HTML>
      <html>
      """
    And the command output should contain:
      """
        <head>
          <title>Behave Test Report</title>
          <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">
          <style type="text/css">
      """
    And the command output should contain:
      """
          </style>
          <script type="text/javascript">
      """
    And the command output should contain:
      """
          </script>
        </head>
        <body>
      """
    And the command output should contain:
      """
          </h1>Behave Test Report</h1>
      """
    And the command output should contain:
      """
        </body>
      </html>
      """
